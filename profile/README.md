### [QtKeyboardMonitor](https://github.com/scytheStudio/qtkeyboardmonitor)

This project was created using Qt to track keyboard usage on Windows. The app uses Windows libraries to check the state of keyboard buttons. Moreover, it also checks mouse movement. How does it work may you ask? The key state is checked every single time the timer is triggered. The timer is activated every 100ms. User activity is measured with three variables APS, APM, and avarageAps.
